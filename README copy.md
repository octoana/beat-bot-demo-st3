# Smart Scan
Smart-scan is an AI assistant that helps decide when to run a security analysis using CodeQL.  Not every PR needs to have a CodeQL scan run. Sometimes, you're only updating a markdown file, or maybe you're only changing pieces of code that have no potential security impact.

This is an experiment to see if we can introduce CodeQL scans only when they're actually needed.  

## How it works
Smart-scan is an action backed by OpenAI.  When a PR is triggered, this action sends the diff to GPT where a deicion is made about the change.  If the change impacts the operation of your application, smart-scan triggers a CodeQL scan for an in-depth SAST scan.  If there are no operational changes to the application, the CodeQL scan is skipped.

**Here's a screenshot of smart-scan in action**

## How to use smart-scan
* Enter your OpenAI API key as a new Actions secret called `OPENAI_KEY`
* Edit your `codeql.yml` workflow to add this action as a new job before your `analyze` job:
  ```
  jobs:
    smart_scan:
      name: "run smart scan"
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      outputs:
        decision: ${{ steps.decide.outputs.decision }}
      steps:
        - uses: leftrightleft/smart-scan@main
          id: decide 
          with:
            openai_api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_KEY }}
            gh_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    ...
  ```
* Edit the `analyze` job to only trigger on completion of the `smart_scan` job using the `needs:` and `if:` statements below:
  ```
    analyze:
      needs: smart_scan
      if: needs.smart_scan.outputs.decision == 'yes'
      name: Analyze

Here's a full example workflow for a python repository:
```
# For most projects, this workflow file will not need changing; you simply need
# to commit it to your repository.

# You may wish to alter this file to override the set of languages analyzed,
# or to provide custom queries or build logic.

# ******** NOTE ********
# We have attempted to detect the languages in your repository. Please check
# the `language` matrix defined below to confirm you have the correct set of
# supported CodeQL languages.
